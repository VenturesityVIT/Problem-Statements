# Problem Statements

## Machine Learning
- Chatbot to make learning stuff online easier (Coursera, EdX).
- Develop a solution based on sophisticated algorithms that can be used to cross check the veracity of information available online. Software should combine all sources and provide filter options so that information from unverified sources can be eliminated.

## Smart Cities
- Design a system that allows people to freelance domestic work in an urban city without having to go through the hassles of web hosting.
- Find a way to maximize the usage of mobile phone data for every person each day (it renews at 12:00 am, don't let it get wasted and maybe market that unused data)
- Find a way to optimize e-waste in smart cities and turn the e-waste into revenue.
